##PARACHUTES - A7

Important information
- Must be run on Lab2 machines in the CADE lab because of the Boost libraries that are installed. One could try to install the Boost, but we're not exactly sure how it would affect everything.
- Teacher Account
  - Username: yoda
  - Password: green
  - When signing in, the web page is opened for a teacher to enter their name and see their students' progress.
  - Must type in exact username of teacher and press "Send"
- Student Account
  - You can create an account (by joining classes offered by teachers 'yoda' or 'sidious'), or you can use one of our existing accounts. Keep in mind that some players have beaten all of their teacher's levels and that they cannot play until the teacher releases more lists
  - Sample account:
    - Username: superman
    - Password: krypton8
- Database Issues
  - Because we use a free Azure-based MySql database, there are only 4 connections allowed at any given time. If the server won't launch and tells you that you've reached the maximum number of connections, email [Tanner Barlow](mailto:tanner.barlow@utah.edu) so that he can clear all connections and you can proceed with grading or playing our game.
- Gameplay
  - The user has a limited time to type the letters in order that they were first dropped in. But be careful! As soon as they hit the ground, the letters will be shuffled beyond recognition. So read fast and type fast
  - The user will advance automatically through the levels until all levels have been beaten or they have run out of time.

Thanks for reading and enjoy our educational app!
